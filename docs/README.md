This is my main website.

#### I have included some libraries (full list at bottom of readme), and I think it is ok to use them? Let me know if there is a library that I can't use. I am giving them credit.

### List of librarys:
- [three.js](https://threejs.org/) - for my 3D javascript stuff (In my view this is a bit trickier, but more functionality)
- [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) - for my 3D HTML stuff (In my view this easier to use, but with less functionality)
